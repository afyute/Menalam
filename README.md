# Menalam - A Telehealth Platform for Women with Disabilities
Project Prototype for Diliman Solutions Challenge '21. 

Menalam —  named after a female goddess of health and healing in Filipino mythology — is a telehealth platform for WWDs primarily geared towards those living in rural areas, where there is no access to practitioners and specialists for PWDs. The mobile application enables convenient virtual visits to the doctor, time-saving medical care, efficient medical data storage and management, and better facilitation of administrative operations. Using the data collected from market studies, Google-based technologies will be used to design and create an application that provides remote quality health services for WWDs.
